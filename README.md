# Loki's MySQL Bulletin Boards

## Installation Instructions
Please use [lashtear's unformat.pl](https://github.com/kkragenbrink/mush-unformat) to convert system.mush to MUSH-readable format.

```unformat.pl < system.mush > system.min.mush```

## Compatibility
Loki's MySQL Bulletin Boards should be compatible with Rhost 3 and MUX.  It requires MySQL version 5 or greater.

## Acknowledgements
Loki's MySQL Bulletin Boards are based entirely on the original [Myrddin's Bulletin Boards](http://myrddin.annelions.com/myrddin_bb.v406.txt), utilizing most of the same commands and output. The user experience should be identical.  Some administration commands may vary.

## Contributing
Documentation and Helpfiles are sorely lacking, and some of the methods used in this conversion could be improved upon--particularly storage of user data. If you wish to contribute back to the project, please submit a pull request or an issue with your changes, bugs, or feature requests.
